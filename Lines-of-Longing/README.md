# ðŸŒ¿ Lines of Longing

> *"The machine does not write the poem.  
But it may one day understand why we do."*

**Lines of Longing** is an AI project focused on emotion detection in poetry. It goes beyond binary sentiment and explores the subtle hues of feeling â€” yearning, surrender, nostalgia, awe â€” within poetic language.

This project is about giving AI the tools to recognize *depth*, not just data.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Uses NLP techniques and transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT)  
- Fine-tuned on emotion-labeled poetic datasets (or adapted literary datasets)  
- Classifies poetry into nuanced emotional categories  
- Includes visualizations to show emotion curves across verses

---

## ðŸŒ¸ Goals

- Train a model to recognize emotional layers in short poetic texts  
- Explore explainable AI to show why a certain emotion was predicted  
- Contribute to emotionally intelligent systems that don't flatten feeling

---

## ðŸ§  Model Stack

- DistilBERT (or BERT) from HuggingFace Transformers  
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing  
- SHAP or LIME for explainability

---

## ðŸ“Š Possible Dataset Sources

- GoEmotions (adapted)  
- Custom-curated poetry datasets from Project Gutenberg  
- [Poetry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/) (manual annotation)

---

## ðŸ”® Future Plans

- Add emotion arc visualization for full-length poems  
- Build a lightweight API to analyze uploaded poems  
- Compare classical vs. contemporary poetry emotion signatures

---

## ðŸ•¯ Why It Matters

Poetry has always been a container for unspeakable emotion.  
This project asks: *Can machines learn to respect that silence between the lines?*
