# 🪞 VerseMirror

> *"You wrote to me in silence, and I replied in verse."*

**VerseMirror** is an empathetic AI agent that responds in poetry based on the user’s emotional tone. It’s not a chatbot — it’s a soft reflection. A mirror that returns your feelings in lyrical form.

Built for those who speak best through metaphor.
