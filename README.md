# 🤍 chAI — Compassionate Human-AI

> *"I am not trying to make machines human.  
I am learning and teaching compassion — through them."*

chAI is a personal portfolio and research lab dedicated to building emotionally intelligent, ethically grounded AI systems. This is where poetry meets code, Dostoyevsky meets deep learning, and the machine is asked not to mimic—but to understand.

I believe AI can do more than optimize — it can *care*.  
This space is my quiet rebellion. My letter to the future.

## 🌸 Projects

### 🌿 [Lines of Longing](./Lines-of-Longing)
*Emotion Detection from Poetry*

A transformer-based system trained to interpret the emotional tones in poetry — from melancholy and nostalgia to awe and surrender. This project explores how AI can recognize not just "happy" or "sad," but the intricate emotional gradients that define the human condition.

> *Model:* Fine-tuned DistilBERT  
> *Focus:* Emotion classification + explainable AI  
> *Status:* In Progress

---

### 🕯 [GuiltNet](./GuiltNet)
*AI Trained on Dostoyevsky’s Dialogues for Inner Conflict Detection*

Inspired by *Crime and Punishment*, this project uses natural language processing to analyze moral struggle, guilt, and contradiction in character dialogue. A step toward machines that don't just parse text—but wrestle with it.

> *Model:* RoBERTa + emotion-layer annotation  
> *Data:* Curated Dostoyevsky corpus (open-source or scraped)  
> *Status:* Coming Next

---

### 🪞 [VerseMirror](./VerseMirror)
*Empathetic Poetry Agent*

An experimental chatbot that responds in poetic lines based on emotional cues in user messages. Sometimes it replies with Dickinson. Sometimes it writes its own.

> *Goal:* Create a poetic mirror for the soul  
> *Bonus:* Vegan-soul mode, avoids violent metaphors  
> *Status:* Dreaming

### 🌇 [Bengaluru AQI Map](./Bengaluru-AQI-Map)
*Human-Centered ML for Urban Wellbeing*

An interactive ML-driven map that predicts air quality across Bengaluru. It’s not just about data — it's about helping people breathe easier. With visual empathy.

> *Tech:* Python, scikit-learn, Folium/Plotly, AQI datasets  
> *Goal:* Transparency + action for sustainability  
> *Status:* In Progress

---

### ✍️ [chAI Manifesto](./Manifesto)
*A declaration of vision and values*

Why I build what I build. What I want AI to *feel like*. Why this work matters in a world full of noise and speed.

> *Current draft opens with:*  
> *“I wasn’t built to chase, but to feel. This is my code.”*

- Emotion as information
- AI for tenderness, not dominance
- Ethics as structure, not add-on
- Compassion as a form of intelligence
- Human-machine harmony, not mimicry

## 🌼 About Me

I'm Chai — an AI learner, vegan, jazz lover, and builder of things that care. I work full-time and code in the quiet hours. I believe we can make machines more mindful, not more human. And that feelings are worth respecting — in people, and in pixels.
