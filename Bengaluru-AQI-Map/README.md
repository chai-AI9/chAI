# 🌇 Bengaluru AQI Map

> *“Air is a right. Let’s make its quality visible.”*

**Bengaluru AQI Map** is a human-centered ML project that predicts and visualizes air quality across the city. It’s built for transparency, awareness, and gentle action toward sustainability.

This project focuses on clean code *and* clean air.

## 📍 What It Does

- Pulls air quality data from open datasets or APIs  
- Trains ML models to predict AQI across Bengaluru zones  
- Visualizes AQI in an interactive map using Folium or Plotly  
- Explores correlations: traffic, weather, green cover

---

## 🌿 Tech Stack

- `Python`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`  
- `Folium` or `Plotly` for map-based UI  
- `Streamlit` or `Gradio` (optional for web app)

---

## 📊 Dataset Sources

- Open Government Data (India AQI)  
- Kaggle city pollution datasets  
- Public APIs like [waqi.info](https://waqi.info)  

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a predictive model for AQI in different city zones  
- Highlight patterns & risk areas  
- Create a visual tool for residents to understand air quality

---

## 💭 Future Features

- Daily forecast dashboard  
- Pollution contributor breakdown (e.g., vehicle, dust)  
- Alert system with gentle UI + daily poetic air messages

## 🕊️ Why It Matters

Data can suffocate — or it can breathe.  
**This project makes it easier to care.**
